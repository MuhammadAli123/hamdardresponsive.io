                                        <p>The aim of Hamdard Foundation Pakistan is to create excellent educational institutions at higher levels. It is aware of the fact that the contemporary state of education in the developing world is not satisfactory and is not in line with our psyche. The aim in establishing the Public School system is to create a dignified personality and in higher education to develop a new paradigm of knowledge which can go beyond the narrow confines of information trade. In simple terms, students are taught to keep “the company of great thoughts, the inspiration of great ideals, the example of great achievements, the consolation of great failures” so that fortified with character and spirit they may face life with dignity and courage.</p>
                                        <p>A strong and lasting personal contact is a pre-requisite of high standard education and training. This is possible only if a reasonable balance is created between the number of students and teachers. This compatibility has to be ensured so that a teacher is able to pay maximum attention to all the students. The maximum number of students per class at Hamdard Public School is 30.</p>
